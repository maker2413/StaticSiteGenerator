#+TITLE: Static Site Generator

This is just a simple static site generator that will convert Markdown files
into HTML files.

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To run the program you will just need to run:
#+begin_src shell
  ./main.sh
#+end_src

This will build out any Markdown files in the ~content~ directory into HTML
files and put them in the ~public~ directory.
